# Osmus game

Osmus is a clone of popular game called [Osmos](https://www.osmos-game.com/).
It's an ongoing project that helps me learn Clojure and have some fun.

The game is about blobs of energy moving around and eating each other.
Big blobs eat small ones and grow as a result. To move around a blob
has to shoot out in the opposite direction. When it shoots it spends
a small portion of energy and gets smaller, but gains movement speed.
